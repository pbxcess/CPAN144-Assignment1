This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn-pages-router) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

This is the assignment 1
These are the deliverables needed for the assignment:
Deliverables:
1. Web Application:
- Create a React web application using Next.js that includes:
- A home page with a welcome message.
- A navigation menu to navigate between components.
- At least two additional pages/components that demonstrate different features.
2. Components:
- Create at least three components, each handling its own state.
- Use props to pass data between components.
3. Event Handling:
- Implement event handlers for at least two different user interactions (e.g., button clicks,
form submissions).
- Ensure that user actions update the component state appropriately.
4. Conditional Rendering:
- Use conditional rendering to display content based on the state. For example, show
different messages or elements depending on user input.
5. Styling:
- Style your application using CSS to enhance the user interface.
- Ensure that your application is visually appealing and user-friendly.
Submission Guidelines:
• Submit your web application as a GitHub repository link.
• Ensure your code is well-documented with comments explaining key parts of
your implementation.
• Provide screenshots of your application in action, showcasing the functionality
you implemented.
